# Smart Home Management System

## Overview
A full-stack web application to monitor and control home devices with user interaction, built as a college project using HTML, PHP, Tailwind CSS, Laravel, and MySQL.

## Features
- User-friendly frontend interfaces
- Backend logic with PHP and Laravel
- Energy usage handling and basic appliance control
- Static pages and database interaction via Laravel routes

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind can be added on future improvement)
- Backend: PHP, Laravel
- Database: MySQL
- Optional media assets stored in `images/`

## Project Structure
    SmartHomeProject/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── app/
    │   ├── public/
    │   └── routes/
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── contact.html
    │   ├── main.js
    │   ├── styl.css
    │   └── contact.css
    ├── images/
    │   └── (project images)
    ├── README.md

## How It Works
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the backend in Laravel (set `.env` with MySQL credentials).
3. Place frontend pages under `frontend/`.
4. Open `index.html` to launch the landing page.
5. Backend Laravel routes connect pages with database actions.

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time device controls
- Integrate API endpoints for frontend consumption
- Add authentication with Laravel Breeze or Jetstream
